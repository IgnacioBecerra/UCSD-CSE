      This CSE 15L lab has two components: a lab exercise, and a quiz. 
    </li>
    <li>
      For the lab exercise, you’ll be working in a team of two: pair programming, two people to one machine. You just need to login as ONE of you, using your cs15xxx user name.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the lab quiz, you will work individually.
    </li>
    <li>
       Switch drivers (student on the keyboard) every 20 minutes.

<h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1><hr id="hrline">

<p>In this general guide, you will find information about how to go through labs, as well as logistics such as grading policies and changing sections.</p>

<h1 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h1><hr id="hrline">

<h2 id="pairprogramming">Pair Programming</h2>

<p>Each lab is meant to be done in pairs so that two people share one machine (pair programming). You should be assigned a partner on the seating chart, which will change weekly. This means that, between you and your partner, only one of you should be logged into your cs15xxx account. To look up your account, you can go <a href="https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php">here</a>. </p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, you should switch drivers (student on the keyboard) every 20 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="theterminal">The Terminal</h2>

<p>Once you are logged in, you should open a browser to the lab link given by the lab tutors. Additionally, you should open a terminal. The terminal is your best friend for this course! You will become very familiar with it by the end of this quarter. To open the terminal, right-click on your desktop and click "Open Terminal". </p>

<p>Anytime that you are asked to type something of the following format, you type only what is after the <code>$</code> sign:</p>

<pre><code>$ pwd
</code></pre>

<h1 id="readmefile">README file</h1><hr id="hrline">

<p>At the start of each lab, you should create a lab folder in your home directory and inside, a README file for that lab. This allows you to keep track of your progress and should help you study for the lab quizzes. Additionally, this README allows lab tutors to check you off at the end of a lab.</p>

<h1 id="policies">Policies</h1><hr id="hrline">

<p>Please thoroughly review the policies found <a href="http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs15x/policies.html">here</a> for information about how grading works and how to switch sections.</p>

<h1 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h1><hr id="hrline">

<p>Quizzes are handed out in the first 15 minutes of every lab session with the exception of the lab during the first week of the quarter. They are taken individually.</p>

<p>The quiz will contain material from the lab from the previous week. For example, the quiz during the week of Lab 3 will test material from Lab 2. This gives you a week to study the material.</p>

<p>To help you with studying for the quiz, you should attempt to answer every question you see throughout all the labs.</p>

<h2 id="pickingupgradedquizzes">Picking Up Graded Quizzes</h2>

<p>Graded quizzes are usually passed back one week after they have been taken to the same time/location that they were taken. For example, if you took your quiz during the XX:00 AM lab on XXday, you can expect it to be passed back at that time. If you happen to change lab times for that week or miss that lab, you can always pick it up the following week by asking a lab tutor. When a quiz is not picked up, it is sorted into a single pile of unclaimed quizzes which is maintained throughout the quarter.</p>

<h1 id="gettingcheckedoff">Getting Checked Off</h1><hr id="hrline">

<p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> Before you leave the lab, you should get checked off or you will not receive any participation points for the lab, regardless if you were there or not. Additionally, please do not leave the lab until you receive an email confirming that you were checked off. This is your receipt and proof that you completed the lab.</p>

<p>If you and your partner finish early, you should raise your hand and prepare to answer any questions or show your work to a lab tutor in order to get checked off. Once you are checked off, you may leave.</p>

<p>On the occasion that you were unable to finish your lab on time, you should still make sure to get checked off by a lab tutor before you leave! Additionally, it is in your best interest to still complete the lab in your own time to study for the quiz at the following lab.</p>

<h1 id="afterthelab">After The Lab</h1><hr id="hrline">

<p>The lab for the week will be posted on the lab website after the last lab session of that week has finished. A working link to the lab will be posted <a href="http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs15x/labs/">here</a>, and will stay for the remainder of the quarter. If you did not finish the lab, you should still attempt to finish it. Please also make sure to study for the quiz by going back through the lab!</p>

<h1 id="checkoff">Checkoff</h1><hr id="hrline">

<p>If you are seeing this guide as part of Lab 1, please answer the following questions on a piece of paper in order to get checked off for Lab 1.</p>

<ol>
<li>What is an example of a question that would result in a professionalism deduction?</li>

<li>If you do not finish a lab by the time your lab section is over, should you still get checked off?</li>

<li>What is the deadline for switching lab sections? (Hint: The answer is not Tuesday at 11:59PM, it is another day at 11:59PM)</li>

<li>What is your cs15 account?</li>

<li>How often should you switch drivers (unless otherwise stated)?</li>
</ol>

<p>You may now return to and continue Lab 1.</p></div> <!-- End main_content -->
